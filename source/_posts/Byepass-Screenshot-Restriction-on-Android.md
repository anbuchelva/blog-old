Taking screenshots is a common activity, a normal user would do in all kind of electronic platforms.  I do not remember having restrictions in taking screenshots on Windows PC.  It used to be similar in [Android](/Android/f) platform until Google introduce restrictions from taking a screenshot.

Is there a way to bypass it? Yes!, there are...

1. [Root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooting_(Android)) your device, install [Xposed framework](https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/xposed-installer-versions-changelog-t2714053) - and lose warranty :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
2. Cast your device to another device, such as windows PC, then take a screenshot on the PC - how complex it is?
3. Its my way, which is the easiest one..

Pressing and holding `Volume Down` and `Power Key` simultaneously would take screenshot in Android.  This won't work on the restricted apps and you would get an error notification that `Taking screenshots isn't allowed by the app or your organization`.

I'm not going to suggest any magic to take a screenshots in such cases.  Just use the _Google Assistant_ to take a screenshot. Voila! It would byepass the security and grab the screen context to you.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following on your Android device.

* Your device's Android version should be Marshmallow (6.0) or above
* Google application should be there
* Option to trigger Google Assistant (either press and hold home button & 'OK Google' by voice)
* Enable the option to read screen context (available in Google App > More > Settings > Settings > Phone > Use screen context)

# Process
* Just open the app that has restrictions in taking screenshot.
* Say 'OK Google' or press & hold the Home button, which will trigger the Google Assistant.
* Say `Take Screenshot`, which will take the screenshot of the app that has restrictions. You can share it via other applications or save in the storage.

That's all!! This would __NOT__ require rooting, installing any unknown applications on your phone. It would work untill Google fixes this _bug_!

# Video Explanation
I have made a video, to explain the same using __Telegram Secret Chat__ feature.  You may apply the same in snapchat, UTS app, etc.,
