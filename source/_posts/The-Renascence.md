This has been very long time, since I stopped writing blogs. I started with blogger in 2008; was writing about my phases of life, learning, activities, people I missed/lost, poems, festival, tips, tricks, etc.,  
<!---more--->
A lot of people appreciated for writing good stuff; some posts made people laugh, cry, think and even fight.  I stopped writing after some time.  I started writing back here not sure I will continue; _its just a renascence,_ that's how I would like to call.  

I would possibility write about _The Simplest Things That Could Possibly Work_.

Happy Writing!!
