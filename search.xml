    <title><![CDATA[Bypass Screenshot Restriction on Android]]></title>
    <url>%2FAndroid%2FBypass-Screenshot-Restriction-on-Android%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Taking screenshots is a common activity, a normal user would do in all kind of electronic platforms. I do not remember having restrictions in taking screenshots on Windows PC. It used to be similar in Android platform until Google introduce restrictions from taking a screenshot. Is there a way to bypass it? Yes!, there are… Root your device, install Xposed framework - and lose warranty 😜 Cast your device to another device, such as windows PC, then take a screenshot on the PC - how complex it is? Its my way, which is the easiest one… Pressing and holding Volume Down and Power Key simultaneously would take screenshot in Android. This won’t work on the restricted apps and you would get an error notification that Taking screenshots isn't allowed by the app or your organization. I’m not going to suggest any magic to take a screenshots in such cases. Just use the Google Assistant to take a screenshot. Voila! It would byepass the security and grab the screen context to you. Prerequisites Make sure you have the following on your Android device. Your device’s Android version should be Marshmallow (6.0) or above Google application should be there Option to trigger Google Assistant (either press and hold home button &amp; ‘OK Google’ by voice) Enable the option to read screen context (available in Google App &gt; More &gt; Settings &gt; Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Use screen context) Process Just open the app that has restrictions in taking screenshot. Say ‘OK Google’ or press &amp; hold the Home button, which will trigger the Google Assistant. Say Take Screenshot, which will take the screenshot of the app that has restrictions. You can share it via other applications or save in the storage. That’s all!! This would NOT require rooting, installing any unknown applications on your phone. It would work untill Google fixes this bug! Video Explanation I have made a video, to explain the same using Telegram Secret Chat feature. You may apply the same in snapchat, UTS app, etc.,]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Common Connection Name in Smartview Functions]]></title>
    <url>%2FHyperion%2FCommon-Connection-Name-in-Smartview-Functions%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Another big gap from the previous post. I was being busy in the budgetting acitivities (which started in last Mar), as usual there were many change requests, allocation logic changes, etc., occupied most of my time. The budget is officially over and 2 forecast cycles are passed. So, I am free for sometime. Just wanted to share my experience, while setting up the inbuilt functions/formulas using SmartView. The Process We built few SmartView Templates using HSGetValue, HSSetValue, etc., The users just refresh the worksheets, they get the custom reports very easily. We advised them to create private connections before setting up any such functions. The private connections are being used as ConnectionName filed. The Problem Each user started using the Private Connection Name for their convenient, start preparing their own templates When they share their workings to other user, it won’t work as theConnectionName is different When they login to another PC / get a laptop replacement, they need to setup the connection name again There were many queries arised and we were asked to support Possible Solution Prepare a list of ConnectionName for each application and share with the users, so that all the users will use the same name for private connections. The problem is to educate the users and make them to follow it, when the user base is bit high. The Solution Setup a global ConnectionName which is common for all the users and doesn’t use the Private Connection name. The provision was already given by Oracle. The Syntex is given below: 1WSFN|ProviderType|Server|Application|Database each of the field is broken by pipeline symbol, without any spaces. This ConnectionName can be used in Essbase, Hyperion Planning and Hyperion Financial Management by changing the Provider Type field. Example syntex for each of them: Essbase: 1WSFN|Essbase|Essbasecluster-1|Sample|Basic Hyperion Planning (HP) 1WSFN|HP|localhost|Samplan|BudPlan Hyperion Financial Management (HFM) 1WSFN|HFM|localhost|HFMApp|HFMApp This can be stored in an excel cell and referred for the each formula you make. This connection name would be common for all the users; no issues while sharing the workings, changing PC/Laptop, etc.,]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Valid Intersections in Hyperion Planning]]></title>
    <url>%2FHyperion%2Fvalid-intersections-in-hyperion-planning%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I recently encountered with a requirement that the users should input data in the Planning Forms only for Valid Intersection. There’s an option to setup Valid Intersection in PBCS. But, the requirement is to setup the same on premises environment. You ask me how to do it in Microsoft Excel using VBA or Microsoft Access using SQL Query, I would do it very easily. But in Hyperion Planning, there’s no such option available inbuilt. The Problem There are two dimensions in a classic Planning Application having many to many relationship. The user should select the correct combination in the web forms/SmartView and input the data. There should be restrictions setup for selecting/updating in incorrect combinations. Lets assume the application is having following dimensions. Year Period Scenario Version Currency Entity Operating Unit Business Unit Here the Operating Unit and the Business Unit are the problem area. Possible Solution Restrict user access for only the Valid Intersection. But it will overlap and create mess, if the user has access to more than one Valid Intersection. Solution Step 1: Create 2 Account members Create an Account member named Valid Intersection and set the member property to refer Yes/No Smart list Value Create a dynamic calc member and add this formula [&quot;Current Year&quot;] -&gt; &quot;BegBalance&quot; -&gt; [&quot;Current Scenario&quot;] -&gt; [&quot;Current Version&quot;] -&gt; [&quot;Currency where the inputs to be made&quot;] -&gt; &quot;No Entity&quot; Note: the brackets to be removed after updating the correct members. Step 2: Setup web form to collect the right intersections. Setup a web from by selecting the above mentioned members in the POV section and the Operating Unit / Business Unit in Rows/Columns. Account should be “Valid Intersection”, which we created in step 1. The form should be available as below: POV / Page : FY18 -&gt; BegBalance -&gt; Current -&gt; Working -&gt; Local -&gt; No Entity BU1 BU2 BU3 BUn OU1 Yes OU2 Yes OU3 Yes OU4 Yes The dyn_Valid Intersection member would give an output as 0 or 1 (yes or no) for these BU / OU irrespective of selections in the other dimensions. Step 3: Include the dyn_Valid Intersection member in the forms and setup validation rules. Open the form in Edit mode and go to Layout tab. Add the dyn_Valid Intersection member in the first row of every form, where you want to set up this validation. I’m trying to find a way to achieve the output without adding a row Select Validation Rules from right pane, click the + sign and setup a validation rule as like the screen shot I keep the process format in grey, as it would mimic the user that the cell is for editing, though it is editable. You may add a Validation Message which will be displayed to the users upon error. Once done, click Validate to validate the Validation Rule 😉 Now open the form to input data and select incorrect combination from the Page section / drop down. You will see all the cells are grayed out. When you try to input data in a store member, you will get the error message that was setup in the Validation Rule. It doesn’t restrict user to input on the invalid intersections. However, it just give a warning to them that they have selected invalid intersections and inputting data. Step 4: Setup a Business rule to validate the intersections while saving form. As an additional way to restrict processing calculations for the invalid intersections, we can setup a Business Rule and place it in the first position with @Return message. sample code is given below: 123456FIX(&quot;FY18&quot;,&#123;RTP_BU&#125;,&#123;RTP_OU&#125;) &quot;Valid Intersection&quot;( IF(&quot;dyn_Valid Intersection&quot; &lt;&gt; 1)) @RETURN(&quot;Invalid BU x OU selected, pls select the valid BU x OU&quot;, Error); ENDIF)ENDFIX All these checks would work only for form. There’s no way to restrict, if an user prefer to load data through ad-hoc smartview query or try loading through back end. Conclusion This would be very easy (Step 3 is not needed), if Oracle provides an option to run a Business Rule while loading the form with Run Time Prompt. It is not supported and we need to do all these steps as workaround.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Blogging in the Hard Way]]></title>
    <url>%2FBlog%2FBlogging-in-the-Hard-Way%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I have started this blog in last November, after that I did not write anything, as like the way it happens every time. We start something and forget, until we make it as routine. Meanwhile, I was doing some analysis and checks, etc on the blogging platform. Like to share the same here… The Static Blog Platform Why Static Blog? I have tried using the ready-made blogging platforms such as Blogger, WordPress, etc., But I settled with Static blogging platform, for its simplicity and speed, also I want to try something in a hard way to make it work (Actually setting up a static blog is not that hard). I can write posts when I am off line, using a notepad++. Then just push to git repository when I connected to Internet. Git provides the history / version control for all the modifications that I do. If I feel a change that I made recently not working, I can just use git revert command to go back to the previous state. I have tried different static site generators the order listed below: Jekyll - Lot of themes available, Github build the pages automatically. But, felt it is slow. Still my primary domain page https://anbuchelva.in is running on Jekyll. Edit: Moved to static page now. Hugo - Simple. But Hexo won my heart. Ghost - Subscription based, not my cup of tea. Hexo - The Winner!! though most of the users are from china, thanks to Google translate Gatsby - The post title would have changed to the Hardest way, if I have used Gatsby. I have tried all the platforms finally settled with Hexo for the speed and the vast number of plug-ins. Github pages automatically build pages, if I use Jekyll. I need a CI to build the site, or I need to deploy it from my PC whenever I write a post using Hexo. I have tried different CI such as Travis-CI, Circle-CI, Netlify, Gitlab CI, etc., Domain I have purchased this domain from Google Domains. I pay $12 per annum for it, which is the only service that I pay money when setting up this blog. Still thinking of moving it to a different domain name, which can be easily remembered. I know the the word ‘anbuchelva’ would be hard to pronounce who are not from South India. Hosting The next question that arise in your mind, what about hosting? Aren’t you paying any money for it? The answer is yes. I’m not paying anything for hosting, as I host it in Github pages There are few alternates available such as Gitlab Pages, Bitbucket, Netlify, etc., I have settled with Github Pages + Cloudflare for hosting and CDN services. Github pages provide very fast server response than the others that I have listed above. This improves the Google page speed drastically. Still thinking of moving the source of this blog to Gitlab or Bitbucket for privacy and host the pages that are built in Github. Github doesn’t offer Private Repository services for free. Few differences when comparing Gitlab and Github. Service Gitlab Github Private Repository Unlimited private repositories Not available Continuous Integration 2000 Hours of CI engine per Month Not available, have to depend on other CI cervices like Travis-CI, Circe-CI, Netlify Encryption The connection is encrypted between Gitlab and Cloudflare No encryption provided for custom domain Server Response Time Slow Fast improvement in Google Page Speed test for more than 20 points Netlify CMS Integration Not available yet Available Cloudflare I should thank Cloudflare for their free service for ultra fast CDN and free encryption certificate, caching etc. This increased the site speed from 60/100 to 95+/100. Markdown Writing posts in Markdown language is very easy than using traditional HTML tags. It is in readable format so it’s easy to modify, when the changes needed. Whenever I make changes and push the commits to git repository, the CI automatically build the site to HTML pages. When the user opens up the website, they access the webpages which are built already. There’s no to and fro data data movement to load the pages. Theme I use Next in this blog. Simple and look professional, yet modern. You will really know the customizations when start using it. I love it! Ruda font is being used all over the place except the code blocks. I use the same font in my Android device as well. Continuous Integration [aka] CI There would be a separate post needed, if I want to write about CI and the experiments that I have done, experiences that I have gained with each of the CI platform. As of now, I use Travis-CI and Netlify for building the site. I would write a separate post; the link will be available here when I am done. Post Comments I am still in dilemma whether to use Disqus (most websites uses it, login using social networking is possible) or to use Gitment. There’s no privacy guaranteed when using Disqus, Gitment is open sourced and privacy oriented. The problem is not all the users have github account to use Gitment comment system. I may add staticman, if I succeed. Content Management System What is the success of Wordpress, the simple content management system. As of now, I have to depend on my personal computer, where the git is configured and I can locally run Hexo to see the output before publishing any post. Sometimes it is painful, If I have an online portal, where I can go and write posts and if it automatically publishes it, that’s going to be a welcome change. Currently Netlify provides such option. When a new post created, Netlify creates pull request and builds the website temporarily. Once we feel the post is ready for publishing, it automatically merge the pull request and delete the temporary branch. I have set it up already for this blog, but still not using it 100%, as I do some tweaks in the website. Netlify breaks if there are any commits passed during the draft to publish phase. Ideally I will move into it in some days. Conclusion Thanks for reading the large post. There’s no technical details provided how I have setup each of the above mentioned services. I may write in more detailed way, when I get time. Feel free to comment/ask questions for clarifications. Happy Writing!!!]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This has been very long time, since I stopped writing blogs. I started with blogger in 2008; was writing about my phases of life, learning, activities, people I missed/lost, poems, festival, tips, tricks, etc., A lot of people appreciated for writing good stuff; some posts made people laugh, cry, think and even fight. I stopped writing after some time. I started writing back here not sure I will continue; its just a renascence, that’s how I would like to call. I would possibility write about The Simplest Things That Could Possibly Work. Happy Writing!!]]></content>
